# Predicting Wide Receiver Scores for Fantasy Football
### Overview
This project aims to predict the fantasy football scores of NFL wide receivers. It scrapes individual player receiving and team passing data from pro-football-reference.com, as well as average draft position (ADP) data from myfantasyleague.com for the 1998â€“2016 seasons. The data is cleaned and merged prior to feature engineering. The final dataset is used to make machine learning predictions with an ensemble of 5 algorithms.

### Key Questions Explored
- What is the model accuracy for predicting NFL wide receiver fantasy scores in the upcoming season?
- Which features correlate strongly with next season's fantasy points?
- Does the model improve upon conventional wisdom, i.e. the average draft position of players.

### Key Findings
- The final ensemble model following has an average root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of ~2.8 fantasy points for out-of-sample data using 10-fold cross-validation. 


- For context of the RMSE, the top 10% of wide-receivers score ~15 fantasy points per game (FP/g), while the bottom 10% score ~8 FP/g, resulting in coefficient of variance around 15% and 33% respectively. Considering the small sample sizes for each season (16 games) and volatility of fantasy football performances, these predictions are relatively accurate.


- When comparing the projected rankings of the model (ordinal values) to the average draft position ranking from ~6000 drafts, the model has 30% higher accuracy in predicting the correct ranking for holdout data.

### Techniques used
- pandas and numpy for data scraping, exploration, and cleaning
- Pipeline and GridSearchCV for modeling and optimization
- Ridge / Lasso Regression, RandomForestRegressor, XGBoost, and KNearestNeighbors for modeling
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- seaborn and matplotlib for visualization
