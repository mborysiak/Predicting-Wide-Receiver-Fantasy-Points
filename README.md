# Predicting Wide Receiver Scores for Fantasy Football
### Overview
This project aims to predict the fantasy football scores of NFL wide receivers. It scrapes individual player receiving and team passing data from pro-football-reference.com for the 2000â€“2016 seasons (n=~2200). The data is cleaned and merged prior to feature engineering. The final dataset is transformed using principal component analysis (PCA) and then modeled using linear regression with k-fold cross validation.

### Key Questions Explored
- Can the model accurately predict NFL wide receiver fantasy scores?
- Which features correlate strongly with next season's fantasy points?

### Key Findings
- The final regression model following dimensionality reduction has an average root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) and R^2 value of 2.512 and 0.680 respectively. Using 10-fold cross-validation, the average RMSE and R^2 values were 2.544 and 0.670 for out-of-sample data. 

- For context of the MSE, the top wide-receiver prediction is ~17 fantasy points per game (FP/g), while the 30th ranked wide-receiver is predicted to score ~10 FP/g. Considering the small sample sizes for each season (16 games) and volatility of fantasy football performances, these predictions are relatively accurate.

### Techniques used
- pandas and numpy for data scraping, exploration, and cleaning
- sklearn for principal component dimensionality reduction, regression modeling, and k-fold cross validation
- seaborn and matplotlib for visualization
